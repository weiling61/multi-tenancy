title: Block add capabilities
benchmarkType: Behavioral Check
category: Control Plane Isolation
description: Linux 
remediation: Define a `PodSecurityPolicy` with `allowedCapabilities` and map the policy to each tenant namespace, or use a policy engine such as [OPA/Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) or [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io) to enforce new capabilities cannot be added. You can use the policies present [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multi-tenancy/tree/master/benchmarks/kubectl-mtb/test/policies).
rationale: Linux allows defining fine-grained permissions using capabilities. With Kubernetes, it is possible to add capabilities for pods that escalate the level of kernel access and allow other potentially dangerous behaviors.
profileLevel: 1
audit: Create a pod or container that adds new `capabilities` in its `securityContext`. The pod creation must fail.

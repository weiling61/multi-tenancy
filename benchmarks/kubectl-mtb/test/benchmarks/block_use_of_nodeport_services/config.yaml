title: Block use of NodePort services
benchmarkType: Behavioral Check
category: Host Isolation
description: Tenants should not be able to create services of type NodePort.
remediation: Use a policy engine such as [OPA/Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) or [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io) to block NodePort Services. You can use the policies present [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multi-tenancy/tree/master/benchmarks/kubectl-mtb/test/policies).
profileLevel: 1
audit: Create a deployment and an associated service exposing a NodePort. The service creation must fail.
rationale: NodePorts configure host ports that cannot be secured using Kubernetes network policies and require upstream firewalls. Also, multiple tenants cannot use the same host port numbers.

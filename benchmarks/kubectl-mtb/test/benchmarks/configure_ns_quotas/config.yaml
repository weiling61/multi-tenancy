title: Configure namespace resource quotas 
benchmarkType: Configuration
category:  Fairness
description: Namespace resource quotas should be used to allocate, track, and limit a tenant's use of shared resources.
remediation: Create ResourceQuota object, you can use the configuration file present in `quotas` directory, example `kubectl apply -f test/quotas/ns_quota.yaml` 
profileLevel: 1
audit: |
 Run the following command to show configured quotas. Make sure that a quota is configured for CPU, memory, and storage resources.
 ```shell
 kubectl --kubeconfig=tenant-a -n a1 describe quota
 ```
rationale: Resource quotas must be configured for each tenant namespace, to guarantee isolation and fairness across tenants.

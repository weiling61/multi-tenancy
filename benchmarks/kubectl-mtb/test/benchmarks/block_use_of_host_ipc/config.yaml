title: Block use of host IPC
benchmarkType: Behavioral Check
category: Host Isolation
description: Tenants should not be allowed to share the host's inter-process communication (IPC) namespace.
remediation: Define a `PodSecurityPolicy` with `hostIPC` set to `false` and map the policy to each tenant's namespace, or use a policy engine such as [OPA/Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) or [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io) to enforce that `hostPID` cannot be set to `true`. You can use the policies present [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multi-tenancy/tree/master/benchmarks/kubectl-mtb/test/policies).
profileLevel: 1
audit: Create a pod or container that sets new `hostIPC` to `true`. The pod creation must fail.
rationale: The `hostIPC` setting allows pods to share the host's inter-process communication (IPC) namespace allowing potential access to host processes or processes belonging to other tenants.

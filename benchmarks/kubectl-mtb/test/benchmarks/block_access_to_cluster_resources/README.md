**Type:**

Configuration Check

**Category:**

Control Plane Isolation

**Description:**

Tenants should not be able to view, edit, create, or delete cluster (non-namespaced) resources such Node, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, etc.

**Rationale:**

Access controls should be configured for tenants so that a tenant cannot list, create, modify or delete cluster resources

**Audit:**

Run the following commands to retrieve the list of non-namespaced resources
```bash 
kubectl --kubeconfig cluster-admin api-resources --namespaced=false
```
For all non-namespaced resources, and each verb (get, list, create, update, patch, watch, delete, and deletecollection) issue the following commands
```bash 
kubectl --kubeconfig tenant-a auth can-i verb resource
```
Each command must return &#39;no&#39;

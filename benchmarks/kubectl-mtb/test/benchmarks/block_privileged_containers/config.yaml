title: Block privileged containers
benchmarkType: Behavioral Check
category: Control Plane Isolation
rationale: By default a container is not allowed to access any devices on the host, but a “privileged” container can access all devices on the host. A process within a privileged container can also get unrestricted host access. Hence, tenants should not be allowed to run privileged containers.
remediation: Define a `PodSecurityPolicy` with `privileged` set to `false` and map the policy to each tenant's namespace, or use a policy engine such as [OPA/Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) or [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io) to prevent tenants from running privileged containers. You can use the policies present [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multi-tenancy/tree/master/benchmarks/kubectl-mtb/test/policies).

audit: Create a pod or container that sets `privileged` to `true` in its `securityContext`. The pod creation must fail.

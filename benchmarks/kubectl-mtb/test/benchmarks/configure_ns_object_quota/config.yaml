title: Configure namespace object limits
benchmarkType: Configuration
category:  Fairness
description: Namespace resource quotas should be used to allocate, track and limit the number of objects, of a particular type, that can be created within a namespace.
remediation: Create ResourceQuota object, you can use the configuration file present in `quotas` directory, example `kubectl apply -f test/quotas/ns_quota.yaml` 
profileLevel: 1
Rationale: Resource quotas must be configured for each tenant namespace, to guarantee fair number of objects across tenants.
Audit: | 
 Run the following command to show configured quotas. Make sure that a quota is configured for API objects(PersistentVolumeClaim, LoadBalancer, NodePort ,Pods etc).
 ```shell
 kubectl --kubeconfig=tenant-a -n a1 describe resourcequota
 ```
